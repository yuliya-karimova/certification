The wiper blade shall be\nfixed into the holder as shown below.\nFigure 13\nCross profile of the chloroprene type rubber blade\nKey\n1 Wiper blade lip (5 mm long)\n2 Wiper blade hinge (0.5 mm width)\n3 Wiper blade heel (5 mm long and used to fix the wiper blade to the wiper blade\nholder)\n4 Total length of the wiper blade 11 mm\n5 Total width of the wiper blade 9 mm\n6 Groove used to fix the wiper blade to the wiper blade holder (parts below the arrow\nare outside the wiper blade holder and parts above are within the guide rail of the\nwiper blade holder)\n7 Wiper blade extremity (0.6 mm width)\n7\n4.9.3. Sample\nThe size of the absolutely flat test samples shall be 150 mm x 100 mm\n(slightly larger than the wipe area of 130 mm stroke length and 80 mm wiper\nblade length). The thickness of the test sample shall correspond to the\nthickness of the rigid plastic glazing part.\n4.9.4. Aqueous suspension\nThe aqueous suspension shall contain:\n(a) 195 ± 1 g water (with a hardness of less than 205 mg/l after\nevaporation) (97.5 wt.-per cent)\n72E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n(b) 5 ± 0.2 g so called ISO test dust A4 (according to ISO 12103-1)10\n(2.5 wt.-per cent)\n(c) And shall be freshly prepared at room temperature and stirred before\nuse. This amount of aqueous suspension is sufficient for testing one\nsample and leads to a filling level of around 10 mm in the sample box.\nA new aqueous suspension shall be used for every test.\n4.9.5. Procedure\n4.9.5.1. Sample pre-treatment\nBefore testing the samples shall be cleaned using a soft cloth soaked with iso-\npropanol followed by deionized water and drying. After cleaning the samples\nshall be conditioned for at least 24 hours at 23 °C ± 2 °C and (50 ± 5) per\ncent relative humidity.\nThe initial haze value according to Annex 3, paragraph 4.4.3. of this\nRegulation of the test sample is measured at 9 measurement points across the\nsample (see 4 in Figure 16).\n4.9.5.2. Test equipment pre-check\n4.9.5.2.1. Before the equipment is used for testing samples the back and forth linear\nmotion of the pillars of the base apparatus shall be checked for being uniform\nwithout any disturbance like getting stuck or starting to vibrate.\n4.9.5.2.2. Build up the whole instrument including tray, wiper carriage assembly, wiper\nblade holders and new wiper blades but without sample box and sample (see\nFigure 14). To do so the two new wiper blades shall be mounted to their\nrespective wiper blade holders and the latter ones shall be fixed to the\ncarriage assembly. Then align using a spirit level the base plate where later\nthe sample box will be placed and the wiper carriage assembly. Check that\nthe distances of the two bearings of both self-supporting arms at the wiper\ncarriage assembly and at the wiper blade holder are identical. Furthermore\ncontrol visually that the wiper blade rest on the base plate uniformly without\nlosing contact to the base plate at any point of the wiper blade.\n10 A suitable method (e.g. shaking the storage vessel) shall be used to homogenize the test dust and\nensure that the 5 ± 0.2 g sample has the same type and size distribution than the whole amount\n73E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nFigure 14\nEquipment pre-check\nKey\n1 Wiper carriage assembly moving back and forth\n2 Self-supporting arm\n3 Wiper blade holder\n4 Wiper blade\n11 Stainless steel tray\nPre-check\nA Align base plate with spirit level\nB Align wiper carriage assembly with spirit level\nC Check that the bearings of the self-supporting arms have all the same distance\nD Control visually that the wiper blade touches the base plate uniformly\n4.9.5.2.3. After this pre-check the wiper carriage assemble with the wiper blade holder\nand the wiper blade shall be removed from the base instrument to allow built\nup of the sample boxes.\n4.9.5.2.4. The test shall be carried out under the following conditions: ambient\ntemperature of 20 °C ± 5 °C, atmospheric pressure of 86 kPa to 106 kPa (860\nmbar to 1,060 mbar), and relative humidity of (60 ± 20) per cent.\n4.9.5.3. Abrasion procedure\n4.9.5.3.1. With the instrument described above two samples shall be tested in parallel.\nIn the case there is only one sample to be tested the second sample box needs\nto be fitted with a dummy sample.11\n4.9.5.3.2. The sample box shall be placed into the stainless steel tray and fixed using\nadhesive tape on the two short sides of the box according to Figure 14. It is\nessential that the position of the box leads to a wiping area in exactly the\nmiddle of the sample (see 2 in Figure 16). A spacer plaque adjusted to the\nthickness of the test sample so that the test sample surface and the bottom\nsurface of the sample box are on the same height (no visible gap in height\nbetween sample and bottom surface of the sample box) shall be placed into\nthe hole in the bottom of the sample box.\n11 The dummy sample should have a surface characteristic adapted to the surface characteristic of the\nwiper blade (e.g. both having a hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface) to allow smooth wiping.\n74E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n4.9.5.3.3. The sample shall be placed with the to be tested side facing up (representing\nthe outside surface of the plastic glazing part) into the sample holder of the\nsample box onto the right spacer plaque (which has a soft masking film on its\nsurface to avoid scratching the test samples backside). An adhesive tape shall\nbe used all around the test sample to fix it into the holder and seal the space\nbetween sample edge and sample box (to avoid suspension penetrating\nunderneath the sample). The tape shall be used in such a way that the overlay\nbetween tape and sample is at maximum 10 mm or in other words in such a\nway that the wiping area of the sample (see Figure 16) is free of any adhesive\ntape.\n4.9.5.3.4. After fixing the sample the carriage assembly including wiper holders and\nblades from the pre-check shall be mounted to the pillars of the base\napparatus. Thereby, the wiper blades get into contact with their respective\nsamples. The correct load (15 ± 0.5 g/cm) of the wiper blade onto the sample\nshall be checked using a spring balance.12 Ensure again that the whole\nequipment (especially test sample, box, and carriage assembly inclusive\nwiper holder and blade) is aligned by using a spirit level.\n4.9.5.3.5. A freshly prepared suspension shall be filled into each sample box and then\nthe linear back and forth motion of the wiper blade shall be started.\n4.9.5.3.6. In order to ensure a homogenous abrading it is necessary to follow the action\ndescribed below:\n4.9.5.3.6.1. After half of the test cycle numbers 10,000 cycles the test shall be stopped\nand the two sample boxes shall be exchanged without turning them (see\nFigure 15);13 this leads to an exchange for the two simultaneously tested\nsamples regarding their wiper blades and furthermore alters the alignment of\nthe self-supporting arm carrying the blade (from left to right or the other way\nround).\nFigure 15\nRearrangement of the sample boxes\n12 Spring balance force: 1,177 ± 39 mN since the wiper blade is 80 mm long; the weight of the wiper\nblade holder including wiper blade and contributions of the cantilever arm (only ideally weightless) is\n120 ± 4 g.\n13 Furthermore it is advisable to check if it is necessary to clean the wiper carriage assembly at that stage\nby disassembling and rinsing with water.\n75E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n4.9.5.4. Sample treatment after abrasion\n4.9.5.4.1. When the abrasion test is finished after 20,000 wipe cycles the suspension\nshall be drained and the abraded test samples shall be removed and cleaned\nusing a multistep process including:\n(a) Washing with running water,\n(b) Drying,\n(c) Wiping with an iso-propanol soaked soft cloth,\n(d) Followed by deionized water, and\n(e) Drying.\n4.9.5.4.2. After cleaning the abraded test samples shall be checked for visible chatter\nmarks as this indicates a none uniform movement of the wiper during the\nabrasion test. In case of visible chatter marks this sample shall be discarded\nfrom further investigation and a retest with a new test sample needs to be\ndone.\n4.9.5.4.3. The samples without chatter marks shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours\nat 23 °C ± 2 °C and (50 ± 5) per cent relative humidity. The final haze value\naccording to this Regulation of the test samples shall be measured within the\nmiddle of the samples (area of 75 mm x 60 mm). The area at the edges of the\nsample — 20 mm from the long edges and 37.5 mm from the short edges —\nshall be excluded from the optical measurement. These areas include the\nreversal point of the wiper blade and the two ends of the wiper blade, where\nlocalized different abrasion conditions could exist compared to the middle of\nthe test sample.\n4.9.5.4.4. Nine measurement points according to Figure 16 below shall be used to\ndetermine the delta haze at these points and calculate an average delta haze\nafterwards.\n76E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nFigure 16\nMeasurement points across the sample\nKey\n1 Sample (150 mm x 100 mm)\n2 Wiping area on the sample (130 mm x 80 mm)\n3 Measurement area on the sample (75 mm x 60 mm)\n4 Locations of the 9 reading areas of the haze measurement (including coordinates of\nthe centre of the area)\n4.9.6. Expression of results\nSubtract the initial haze from the final haze for every measurement point, the\ndifference representing the so-called delta haze. Calculate out of these values\nfor the individual measurement points the average delta haze (including\nstandard deviation) resulting from abrasion action of aqueous dirt wiped for\n20,000 cycles on the sample surface by a to be reported wiper blade type.\n5. Test of resistance to high temperature\n5.1. Procedure\nHeat to 100 °C + 0 °C / -2 °C three samples or three square test pieces of at\nleast\n300 mm x 300 mm which have been cut by the laboratory from three\nwindscreens or three glass panes as the case may be, one edge of which\ncorresponds to the upper edge of the glazing.

Collimation-telescope test\nIf necessary, the procedure described in this paragraph shall be applied.\n9.3.1.2.1. Apparatus\nThe apparatus comprises a collimator and a telescope and may be set up in\naccordance with Figure 24. However, any equivalent optical system may be\nused.\n9.3.1.2.2. Procedure\nThe collimation telescope forms at infinity the image of a polar co-ordinate\nsystem with a bright point at its centre (see Figure 25).\nIn the focal plane of the observation telescope, a small opaque spot with a\ndiameter slightly larger than of the projected bright point is placed on the\noptical axis, thus obscuring the bright point.\nWhen a windscreen which exhibits a secondary image is placed between the\ntelescope and the collimator, a second, less bright point appears at a certain\ndistance from the centre of the polar co-ordinate system. The secondary-\nimage separation can be read out as the distance between the points seen\nthrough the observation telescope (see Figure 25). (The distance between the\ndark spot and the bright point at the centre of the polar coordinate system-\nrepresents the optical deviation).\n9.3.1.2.3. Expression of results\nThe windscreen shall first be examined by a simple scanning technique to\nestablish the area giving the strongest secondary image. That area shall then\nbe examined by the collimation-telescope system at the appropriate angle of\nincidence. The maximum secondary-image separation shall be measured.\n9.3.1.3. The direction of observation in the horizontal plane shall be maintained\napproximately normal to the trace of the windscreen in that plane.\n9.3.2. The measurements shall be performed in the zones as defined in\nparagraph 9.2.2. above according to the vehicle categories.\n9.3.2.1. Vehicle type\nThe test shall be repeated if the windscreen is to be fitted to a vehicle of a\ntype in which the forward field of vision differs from that of the vehicle type\nfor which the windscreen has already been approved.\n9.3.3.

No measurements shall be made in a peripheral area 25 mm inboard of the\ndesign glass outline and of any opaque obscuration, provided that it does not\nimpinge into the extended zone A or zone I.\n9.3.5.2. For agricultural and forestry tractors and for construction-site vehicles, no\nmeasurements shall be made in a peripheral area 100 mm wide.\n9.3.5.3. In the case of split windscreens, no measurements shall be made in a strip\n35 mm from the edge of the windscreen, which is adjacent to the dividing\npillar.\n9.3.5.4. A maximum value of 25' of arc is permitted for all portions of zone I or\nzone A in a peripheral area 100 mm inboard of the design glass outline.\n9.3.5.5. Slight deviations from the requirements may be allowed in the reduced test\narea B according to paragraph 2.4. of Annex 21 provided they are localized\nand recorded in the report.\n10. Burning behaviour (fire-resistance) test\n10.1. Purpose and scope of application\nThis method enables the horizontal burning rate of materials used in the\npassenger compartment of motor vehicles (for example, private passenger\ncars, lorries (trucks), estate cars, motor coaches) after exposure to a small\nflame to be determined.\nThis method permits testing of materials and components of a vehicle's\ninterior equipment individually or in combination up to a thickness of 13\nmm. It is used to judge the uniformity of production lots of such materials\nwith respect to their burning behaviour.\nBecause of the many differences between the real-world situation\n(application and orientation within a vehicle, conditions of use, ignition\nsource, etc.) and the precise test conditions prescribed herein, this method\ncannot be considered as suitable for evaluation of all true in-vehicle burning\ncharacteristics.\n10.2. Definitions\n10.2.1. Burning rate: The quotient of the burnt distance measured according to this\nmethod and the time taken to burn that distance. It is expressed in millimetres\nper minute.\n10.2.2. Composite material: A material composed of several layers of similar or\ndifferent materials intimately held together at their surfaces by cementing,\nbonding, cladding, welding, etc.\nWhen different materials are connected together intermittently (for example,\nby sewing, high-frequency-welding, riveting), then in order to permit the\npreparation of individual samples in accordance with paragraph 10.5. below\nsuch materials shall not be considered as composite materials.\n10.2.3. Exposed side: The side which is facing towards the passenger compartment\nwhen the material is mounted in the vehicle.\n10.3. Principle\nA sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the\naction of a defined low-energy flame for 15 seconds in a combustion\nchamber, the flame acting on the free end of the sample. The test determines\nwhether and when the flame is extinguished or the time which the flame\nrequires to proceed over a measured distance.\n95E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n10.4. Apparatus\n10.4.1. Combustion chamber (Figure 26), preferably of stainless steel, having the\ndimensions given in Figure 27.\nThe front of the chamber contains a flame-resistant observation window,\nwhich may cover the entire front and which can be constructed as an access\npanel.\nThe bottom of the chamber has vent holes, and the top has a vent slot all\naround. The combustion chamber is placed on four feet, 10 mm high. The\nchamber may have a hole at one end for the introduction of the sample holder\ncontaining the sample; in the opposite end, a hole is provided for the gas-\nsupply line. Melted material is caught in a pan (see Figure 28) which is\nplaced on the bottom of the chamber between vent holes without covering\nany vent hole area.\nFigure 26\nExample of combustion chamber with sample holder and drip pan\n10.4.2. Sample holder, consisting of two U-shaped metal plates or frames of\ncorrosion-proof material. Dimensions are given in Figure 29.\nThe lower plate is equipped with pins and the upper one with corresponding\nholes, in order to ensure a consistent holding of the sample. The pins also\nserve as measuring points at the beginning and end of the burning distance.\nA support shall be provided in the form of heat-resistant wires 0.25 mm in\ndiameter spanning the frame at 25-mm intervals over the bottom U-shaped\nframe (see Figure 30).\nThe plane of the lower side of samples shall be 178 mm above the floor plate.\nThe distance of the front edge of the sample holder from the end of the\nchamber shall be 22 mm; the distance of the longitudinal sides of the sample\nholder from the sides of the chamber shall be 50 mm (all inside dimensions).\n(See Figures 26 and 27).\n10.4.3. Gas burner\nThe small ignition source is provided by a Bunsen burner having an inside\ndiameter of 9.5 mm. It is so located in the test cabinet that the centre of its\n96E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nnozzle is 19 mm below the centre of the bottom edge of the open end of the\nsample (see Figure 27).\n10.4.4. Test gas\nThe gas supplied to the burner shall have a calorific value of about 38 MJ/m3\n(for example natural gas).\n10.4.5. Metal comb, at least 110 mm in length, with seven or eight smooth rounded\nteeth per 25 mm.\nFigure 27\nExample of combustion chamber\n97E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nFigure 28\nTypical drip pan\nFigure 29\nExample of sample holder\nDimensions in millimetres\naccording to ISO 2768\nFigure 30\nExample of section of lower U-frame design for wire support facility\n98E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n10.4.6. Stop-watch, accurate to 0.5 sec.\n10.4.7. Fume cupboard\nThe combustion chamber may be placed in a fume-cupboard assembly\nprovided that the latter's internal volume is at least 20 times, but not more\nthan 110 times, greater than the volume of the combustion chamber and\nprovided that no single height, width, or length dimension of the fume\ncupboard is greater than 2.5 times either of the other two dimensions.\nBefore the test, the vertical velocity of the air through the fume cupboard shall\nbe measured 100 mm forward of and to the rear of the ultimate site of the\ncombustion chamber. It shall be between 0.10 and 0.30 m/s in order to avoid\npossible discomfort to the operator from combustion products. It is possible to\nuse a fume cupboard with natural ventilation and an appropriate air "

The thickness\nof the sample corresponds to the thickness of the product to be tested. It shall\nnot be more than 13 mm. When sample-taking so permits, the sample shall\nhave a constant section over its entire length. When the shape and dimensions\nof a product do not permit taking a sample of the given size, the following\nminimum dimensions shall be observed:\n(a) For samples having a width of 3 to 60 mm, the length shall be\n356 mm. In this case the material is tested over the product's width;\n(b) For samples having a width of 60 to 100 mm, the length shall be at\nleast 138 mm. In this case the potential burning distance corresponds\nto the length of the sample, the measurement starting at the first\nmeasuring point;\n(c) Samples less than 60 mm wide and less than 356 mm long, and\nsamples 60 to 100 mm wide and less than 138 mm long, cannot be\ntested according to the present method, nor can samples less than\n3 mm wide.\nFigure 31\nSample\nDimensions in millimetres\n254\n38\n127 0\n1\n 6\n0 0 1 0 8\n356\n99E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n10.5.2. Sampling\nAt least five samples shall be taken from the material under test. In materials\nhaving burning rates differing according to the direction of the material (this\nbeing established by preliminary tests) the five (or more) samples shall be\ntaken and be placed in the test apparatus in such a way that the highest\nburning rate will be measured.\nWhen the material is supplied in set widths, a length of at least 500 mm\ncovering the entire width shall be cut. From the piece so cut, the samples\nshall be taken at not less than 100 mm from the edge of the material and at\npoints equidistant from each other.\nSamples shall be taken in the same way from finished products when the\nshape of the product so permits. If the thickness of the product is over 13 mm\nit shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side\nwhich does not face the passenger compartment.\nComposite materials (see paragraph 10.2.2.) shall be tested as if they were\nhomogeneous.\nIn the case of materials comprising superimposed layers of different\ncomposition which are not composite materials, all the layers of material\nincluded within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the\npassenger compartment shall be tested individually.\n10.5.3. Conditioning\nThe samples shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours, but not more than\n7 days, at a temperature of 23 °C ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 per\ncent, and shall be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior\nto testing.\n10.6. Procedure\n10.6.1. Place samples with napped or tufted surfaces on a flat surface, and comb\ntwice against the nap using the comb (paragraph 10.4.5.).\n10.6.2. So place the sample in the sample holder (paragraph 10.4.2.) that the exposed\nside faces downwards, towards the flame.\n10.6.3. Adjust the gas flame to a height of 38 mm using the mark in the chamber, the\nair intake of the burner being closed. The flame shall burn for at least one\nminute, for stabilization, before the first test is started.\n10.6.4. Push the sample holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the\nsample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow.\n10.6.5. Measurement of burning time starts at the moment when the foot of the flame\npasses the first measuring point. Observe the flame propagation on the side\n(upper or lower) which burns faster.\n10.6.6. Measurement of burning time is completed when the flame has come to the\nlast measuring point or when the flame is extinguished before reaching that\npoint. If the flame does not reach the last measuring point, measure the burnt\ndistance up to the point where the flame was extinguished. Burnt distance is\nthe part of the sample destroyed, on the surface or inside, by burning.\n100E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\n10.6.7. If the sample does not ignite or does not continue burning after the burner has\nbeen extinguished, or the flame goes out before reaching the first measuring\npoint, so that no burning time is measured, note in the test report that the\nburning rate is 0 mm/min.\n10.6.8. When running a series of tests or performing repeat tests, make sure before\nstarting a test that the temperature of the combustion chamber and sample\nholder does not exceed 30 °C.\n10.7. Calculation\nThe burning rate B, in millimetres per minute, is given by the formula:\nB = s/t x 60;\nwhere:\ns is the burnt distance, in millimetres,\nt is the time, in seconds, taken to burn the distance s.\n10.8. Indices of difficulty of the secondary characteristics\nNo secondary characteristics are involved.\n10.9. Interpretation of results\n10.9.1. Safety glazing faced with plastics material (paragraph 2.4. of this Regulation)\nand glass-plastics (paragraph 2.5. of this Regulation) shall be considered\nsatisfactory from the point of view of the fire-resistance test if the burn rate\ndoes not exceed 90 mm/min.\n10.9.2. Rigid plastic panes (paragraph 2.6.1. of this Regulation), flexible plastic\npanes (paragraph 2.6.2. of this Regulation) and rigid plastic multiple glazed\nunits shall be considered satisfactory from the point of view of the fire\nresistance test if the burn rate does not exceed 110 mm/min.\n11. Test of resistance to chemicals\n11.1. Chemicals used for the test\n11.1.1. Non-abrasive soap solution: 1 per cent by weight of potassium oleate in\ndeionised water;\n11.1.2. Window-cleaning-solution: an aqueous solution of isopropanol and\ndipropylene glycol monomethyl ether in concentration between 5 and 10 per\ncent by weight each and ammonium hydroxide in concentration between 1\nand 5 per cent by weight;\n11.1.3.

Test method\n11.2.1. Immersion test\nFour samples 180 mm x 25 mm shall be tested for each test and each\nchemical specified in paragraph 11.1. above, using a new test piece for each\ntest and each cleaning product.\nBefore each test, samples shall be cleaned according to the manufacturers\ninstructions, then conditioned for 48 hours at a temperature of 23 °C ± 2 °C\nand a relative humidity of 50 ± 5 per cent. These conditions shall be\nmaintained throughout the tests.\nThe samples shall be completely immersed in the test fluid and held for one\nminute, then removed and immediately wiped dry with a clean absorbent\ncotton cloth.\n11.2.2. Indices of difficulty of the secondary characteristics\nColourless Tinted\nColouring of the 2 2\ninterlayer or of the\nplastics coating\nThe other secondary characteristics are not concerned.\n11.2.3. Interpretation of results\n11.2.3.1. The test for resistance to chemical agents shall be considered to have given a\nsatisfactory result if the sample does not exhibit any softening, tackiness,\ncrazing or apparent loss of transparency.\n11.2.3.2. A set of samples shall be considered satisfactory with regard to the test for\nresistance to chemical agents if at least three of the four tests carried out with\neach chemical have given a satisfactory result.\n11.2.4. Test procedure under load\n11.2.4.1. The chemicals shall be applied to the side of the test piece which represents\nthe outside face of the windscreen or safety glazing pane when mounted on\nthe vehicle while this side is under tensile stress.\nThe sample shall be simply supported as a horizontal level arm between a\nfixed supporting edge at one end in such a way that the entire width will rest\non a cutting edge (fulcrum) which is 51 mm from the fixed end support. A\nload shall be suspended from the free end of the test specimen at a distance of\n102 mm from the fulcrum as shown in Figure 32 below:\n102E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nFigure 32\nMethod of setting up the sample\n11.2.4.2. The load mass shall be 28.7 . t2 g where t is the thickness in mm of the test\nspecimen. The resulting stress on the outer fibre of the sample is\napproximately 6.9 MPa.\nExample: For a 3 mm thick sample placed horizontally between a downward\nfixed edge and an upward fulcrum edge separated by 51 mm the applied\ndownward load at 102 mm from the fulcrum is to be 258 g.\n11.2.4.3. While the sample is stressed, one of the prescribed chemicals shall be applied\nto the top surface of the sample above the fulcrum point. The chemical shall\nbe applied with a soft, 13 mm wide brush, wetted before each stroke. Ten\nindividual strokes at 1 s intervals across the width of the sample, avoiding the\nend and edges, shall be required (see Figure 33).\nFigure 33\nMethod of applying chemicals to the sample\n11.2.5.

The test for resistance to chemical agents shall be considered to have given a\nsatisfactory result if the sample does not exhibit any softening, tackiness,\ncrazing or apparent loss of transparency.\n11.2.6.2. A set of samples shall be considered satisfactory with regard to the test for\nresistance to chemical agents if one of the following conditions is met:\n11.2.6.2.1. All the tests have given a satisfactory result;\n11.2.6.2.2. One test having given an unsatisfactory result, a new series of tests carried\nout on a new set of samples has given a satisfactory result.\n12. Flexibility test and fold test\n12.1. Scope\nWith this test has to be found out whether a plastic is to be classed into the\ncategories of rigid or flexible plastics.\n12.2. Test method\nFrom the material of the nominal thickness a rectangular flat sample 300 mm\nlong and 25 mm wide is cut out and horizontally clamped into a clamping\ndevice in such a way that 275 mm of the length of the sample freely extend\nover the holding device. This free end shall be supported horizontally by an\nappropriate device until the test begins. Sixty seconds after removal of this\nsupport the vertical deviation of the free end is indicated in mm. If this\ndeviation exceeds 50 mm a 180° fold test is performed subsequently. The\nsample is folded concisely, after that it is folded round 0.5 mm thick piece of\nsheet metal in such a way that it tightly contacts it on both sides.\n12.3. Test conditions\nTemperature: 20 °C ± 2 °C\nRelative humidity: 60 ± 5 per cent\n12.4. Requirements\nThe vertical deviation shall be more than 50 mm for flexible plastics, and\n10 seconds after a 180° - folding the material shall not show any fracture-like\ndamages at the point of buckling (see Figure 34).\n13. Cross-cut test\n13.1. Scope\nThis test gives a simple method to determine the adhesion of coatings to the\nsubsurface. The brittleness and other strength characteristics can be\nevaluated.\n13.2. Apparatus\nCutting tool with 6 blades set at 1 mm apart. A magnifying glass with an\nenlargement of 2 x to examine the crosscut specimen (see Figure 35).\n104E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nFigure 34\nArrangement of flexibility test\nFigure 35\nTool with six blades\n13.3. Test Method\nCut through the coating on to the subsurface a pattern with 6 cuts and\nperpendicular to this, another one so that a grid with 25 squares arises (grid-\ncut).\nThe cutting tool should be drawn steadily with a speed of 2 to 5 cm/s so that\nthe cuts reach the subsurface but do not penetrate too deeply.\n105E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3\nThe cutting is conducted in such a way that the two leading heads at the edge\nof the apparatus touch the surface uniformly. After the test the cuts are\nexamined with a magnifying glass to check that they reach the subsurface.\nThe test is carried out at least at two different positions of the sample. After\nthe cuts have been produced they are brushed 5 times with slight pressure in\nboth diagonal directions with a hand brush with polyamide bristles.\n13.4. Interpretation of results\nThe grid cuts are examined with a magnifying glass. If the cut edges are\nperfectly smooth and if no part of the coating is detached then it will be given\na cross cut value of Gt0. If there are small fragments detached at the\nintersection of the cuts and if the exposed area amounts to about 5 per cent of\nthe grid area the cut value is Gt1.\nLarger areas of detachment will be graded in the range Gt2 to Gt5.\nCut value grade Exposed area of the grid area\nGt2 between 5 and 15 per cent\nGt3 between 15 and 35 per cent\nGt4 between 35 and 65 per cent\nGt5 higher than 65 per cent\n106E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3 – Appendix 1\nAnnex 3 - Appendix 1\nDesign drawing of the wiper blade holder\nFigure 1\nCross-cut view of the wiper blade holder with the support plate (left side) and the\nclamping plate (right side)\nDimensions in millimeters\nview A\nFigure 2\nSide view of the support plate (left side) and the clamping plate (right side)\nView from direction A\n107E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3 – Appendix 1\nDimensions in millimeters\nFigure 3\nDetails regarding the area A in figure 2\narea A\n108E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3 – Appendix 1\nFigure 4\n3-D view of the wiper blade holder (after inserting the wiper blade into the support\nplate, the clamping plate is attached and fixed using three screws)\n109E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3 – Appendix 2\nAnnex 3 - Appendix 2\nDesign drawing from the sample box\nFigure 1\nBirds-eye view of the box (dimensions are in mm)\nFigure 2\nCross cut view at A\n110E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nAnnex 3 – Appendix 2\nFigure 3\n3-D view of the box\n111E/ECE/324/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4\nE/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.1/Add.42/Rev.4"
